## Installation

### node js

Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine. You can check your node version by simply typing below commands:

```bash
node -v
```

If you don't have node.js installed in your machine, you can install it from [node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

In case you have older version node.js installed in your machine, you can follow [this guideline](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/update-node-js-version) to update node.js.

### Create React App

Open terminal and 'cd' into the folder where you want your project to reside & enter the below command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app ice-cream-app
```

This will create a new folder called "ice-cream-app" and install everything required to start a new react application.
